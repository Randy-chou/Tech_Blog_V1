# Tech_Blog_V1
## Description
This website is a basic forum or blogging application that allows people to make posts, and comment on eachother posts. The website is able to store account data and allow people to log in while protecting user posts from other users. This project demonstrated my ability to program a fully functioning app using the MVC paradigm.
